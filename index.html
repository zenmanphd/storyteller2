        <h1>“A Drifter in Harmony”</h1> 

 

<h3><em>Harmony Virginia 8:45am Lake Miskwà State Park</em></h3> 

 <br>
 <br>
<p class="maintext">
“It was the park ranger who called it in this morning.” 
<br> 
The deputy leaned into the driver’s side window, his forearm resting on the hood while he briefed the Sheriff.  
<br> 

“Who Coleman? Thought he was out on leave for gout or some bullshit.” said the Sheriff, trying to assess all the places his coffee had spilled during the quaky drive there.  
<br> 
“No, it was Rosa. She’s fairly new. Anyway, she’s down by the lake right now holding off the visitors til we can take a look at the scene for ourselves.”  
<br> 

As the Sheriff hopped out of his jeep, he checked the door one last time. The worn-out seatbelt was always catching. Too many times he’d been spotted driving through town with that gnarled tan strap flapping in the wind outside his door. He joined his deputy by the trail head.  

<br> 
“I guess no one found a body yet or else you would have led with that right Hopkins?” 
<br> 
The Sheriff asked almost optimistically as they stumbled down the rough wooded trail. His deputy sighed ominously. 
<br> "No, but they seem to have found...everything else." 
<br> The Sheriff said nothing more, only gave a slight nod of morbid understanding. The deputy continued to lead the way with nervous expectant energy. Their path ran parallel with a creek still swollen from rain. Recent flooding left a fall-out of debris that studded the narrow trail like rhinestones with rocks and broken branches that bit at their shins and ankles with each step.  

The creek trail would eventually lead them onto the shallow silt shore of the massive Lake Miskwà, where a young, alert park ranger met them. There was an active looking chocolate lab at her side trying his best to sit still.  

<br> “Morning Miss... Anzu...Anzules?"  

<br> "'Rosa' will do Sheriff" <br> The ranger said, politely rescuing her name once again from the grip of southern mispronunciation. She led them along the tree line to a secluded section of the shore. It was at this point that her dog ceased to follow them. He sat some yards back, upright like a sphinx, and with the faintest rumble of a growl. Hopkins knelt facing the dog, patting his knees. <br> “Come on boy, this way.” <br> The dog simply lay down, fixing his eyes on the surface of the water as if some unseen enemy might spring from beneath its leaf-littered surface at any moment. Rosa put a hand on his shoulder. <br> “It’s no use, Duke doesn’t go any further than this spot.” <br> She scratched her dog reassuringly behind the ears and looked up at the Sheriff. <br> “And neither do I.” 

She handed the sheriff a small name tag fixed to a wire clip. It was an old ski pass from the year before to a resort 2 miles away. 

<br> “Duke (the dog) found this along the trail and followed the scent here. His name is Avi Ansari, 23. He told me he was some kind of amateur nature photographer...birds mostly. He rented one of our tent spaces 3 days ago, packed up his camp but never checked out.” 

 She motioned to the section of shore to her left. After some questioning glances the two officers headed over on their own.  

Not a word passed between the two men for some time. It was as if the gravity of the scene before them had pulled them in completely. They were knelt by what appeared to be a large section of the ground that had been burned, or rather scorched. It formed a radial pattern roughly the size of a kitty pool that glittered in the morning sun with irregular chunks of dark glass scattered throughout. Leading away from this spot was a distinct impression in the gray clay silt that ended a few yards at a backpack, abandoned by the water’s edge. These were the only traces they had of what would be their fifth missing hiker in as many months around Lake Miskwà. 

For most people, DeJa'Vu is just a quaint French phrase to describe a whimsical coincidence. For these men DeJa'Vu was a ghost that haunted each new disappearance with an ill-humored familiarity. 

The Sheriff broke the silence. 
<br>  

“Tell me Hopkins, about how many people would you say get struck by lightning each year in this country?” 
<br> 

 The deputy was snapping photos of the scene from every angle and never looked up.
 <br> 

“Probably no more than 300 with even fewer fatalities I’d imagine.” 
<br> 

The Sheriff made his way over to him. 
<br> 

“And I’m willing to bet there ain’t a place on Earth where lightning has ever caused someone to vanish in thin air.”  
<br> 

All Hopkins could do was shrug his shoulders. This was becoming a common sight, no matter how uncommon the circumstances.  

The Sheriff examined the backpack. One of the straps was ripped off. The other partially cut with a serrated edge. He spotted large, deep footprints moving away from the pack in the direction of the burn. 

<br> “He was dragged to this point but managed to cut himself free with a short blade. Maybe a 2-inch pocketknife.” 

<br> Hopkins brought his camera closer to the prints in the clay. 
<br> 

“Something sure scared the hell out of him. These prints face the water once and then haul ass in the opposite direction. But hold on...” <br> 
He laid his camera down, lined his feet up parallel with the impressions and got down on both knees. He looked up at the Sheriff with a look of silent confirmation. 
<br> 
“Don’t tell me this one was tall too.” <br> 
The Sheriff sighed and shook his head in disbelief. 
<br> 

“This fella had to be 6.3 or 6.5 easy, based on how long his shins are.” Hopkins replied excitedly.  
<br> 
His deputy smiled at this, but then lowered his camera to look at the Sheriff. 
<br> 

“You know the chatter back at the office is that we might have some kind of drifter picking these people off. You know...like a serial killer.” 
<br> 
The Sheriff smiled and shook his head. 
<br> 
“You deputies gossip like church ladies. Come on Hopkins, that’s only slightly less likely than lightning. No, unless a body washes up along Miskwà I’m not getting Quantico involved just yet.” 
<br> 
He slipped a few chunks of the glass into a small paper envelope which he placed in his inside coat pocket. 
<br> 
“But who or what could drag a 6 ft tall man with gear and a knife down to the water and leave no footprints themselves?”  
<br> 
The Sheriff shot him an expectant stare, like a professor waiting for the class to answer. 
<br> 
“I know Sheriff. I know. Don’t ask questions until the scene is finished speaking." 
<br> 
They recited together like a nursery rhyme. 

<br>   

“Very good. When we’re done here, I’ve gotta head over to the plant construction site. They had some vandalism last night, and maybe some theft.” 
<br> 
Hopkins looked up at him perplexed.  
<br> 
“Why not send one of the other deputies? You know these kids...back home from their big college towns; all just horny, bored, and reckless.” 
<br> 
The Sheriff sighed, turning back in the direction of the trail.  
<br> 
“No doubt you’re right, but you know this plant is the Mayor’s campaign promise. That means I get to personally inspect broken windows and anarchy symbols drawn in lipstick on bathroom mirrors.  Anyway, I’ll let you know if anything new turns up.”

“All these hiking nuts come here chasing fall colors. They have no idea they’re trotting on graves.”  
<br> 
Edison scoffed bitterly while watching the unbroken line of seasonal traffic snake its way down route 20 through the half-open shutters.  His granddaughter, Alex, was doing inventory behind the bar failing to tune him out. She was taking the semester off and helping at her grandfather’s bar. They’d already debated that morning about her purple hair and ‘distracting’ piercings.  
<br> 
“You’re always so pissy when tourist season hits. We need them Ed. Try not to bum hikers out this year with dead minor stories.”  
<br> 
He abandoned the window, sat at the bar and lit his pipe seemingly disregarding her presence.  
<br> 
“When a town has history folks should know about it.” 
<br> 
Harmony certainly had its history. Mines left deep scars across the Appalachian landscape; exposed cliff faces eroded by wind and neglect, mountain peaks with leveled, bald tops, ash gray with upturned gravel and barren of trees. However, it was the mines themselves that will forever linger in the memory of any townsperson old enough to remember them. “Tragedy in Harmony” the old 1950’s newspapers read with dark-humored irony. When all was said and done it took 10 cave-ins and the lives of 41 minors before the government finally stepped in and declared the sites ‘unfit for operation.’ For nearly a decade the town stagnated in economic ruin. So, when the country’s first nuclear reactor appeared just 200 miles away, the town’s newly elected Mayor leaped at the opportunity.  
</p>
<br> 
<br> 
 

<h3><em>12:30pm Groundbreaking ceremony Miskwà Lake Power Station</em></h3> 
<br> 
<br> 
<p class="maintext">

Reporter 1 - “Do you think Harmony is fiscally ready for a project like this?” 
<br> 
“Well, I believe that question was put on a ballot just last year and here we are. It’s been more than 60 years since my grandfather, the late Mayor Jefferey Holmes, gifted this town with its own nuclear power plant. It brought jobs, clean energy, and most importantly, a second chance. The town of Harmony is a story of reinvention and it’s time to re-invent again.   
<br> 
“I believe we have time for one more question.” The mayor chimed in with a modest attempt at moderating the press. The crowd is an undulating chorus of reporters sparring for the chance to throw out questions.  
<br> 
Reporter 2 – “Dr. Holmes, how can you be so confident that your plant will be fully operational by the end of the year when your own colleagues argue that sustained nuclear fusion reactors probably won’t even be possible for another 30 years?” 
<br> 
The question seems to pacify the crowd under the weight of their own curiosity. Dr. Holmes’ smile widened. 
<br> 
“Right to the point, I like that. It’s true, I spend a lot less time in the lab and more time at press conferences. My colleagues are right to have their doubts. Conventional particle physics presents unavoidable, inherent limitations to generating a fusion reaction. We are trying to replicate conditions that only occur in the center of the sun. We are tempting the physics of stars in the backyard of our humble one post office town of Harmony, Virginia.” 
<br> 
Holmes’s unshakeable Southern drawl added a comical charm to his eloquent delivery of nuclear physics 101 to reporters. He was a likeable, charismatic figure; a living mascot for the company and he was quickly becoming the face of the future of nuclear power itself.   
<br> 
“In basic terms we are forcing together subatomic particles that by divine design repel each other. In a confined space under unfathomable heat the particles will fuse, and this brief interaction will generate an absurd amount of energy.” 
<br> 
He moved his hands as he spoke in an almost choreographed way. It was as if the audience of journalists were a choir he was directing, and they were. What he was attempting was radical, but he knew the more attention he got the more legitimate the project would appear. So, it was on that clear Autumn afternoon the good doctor would go fishing...for public approval. He continued... 
<br> 
“At the same time, we need to contain that energy without vaporizing the glasses off every Ivy-league alum in the control room. Believe it or not, raw energy isn’t that useful. You can’t just plug your cell phone into lightning. We need a process to convert all this cosmic power into a form that’ll play nice with our homes, office buildings, and pizza shops.”  
<br> 
He paused a moment. Ever the dramatists, this was the part he wanted to bring home, staring into one reporter’s eyes as if she were the camera. 
<br> 
“We have found that process!” 
<br> 
The Sheriff listened to the doctor speak with the keenest interest, not in the subject matter, which was a little over his head, but in studying the faces of the other board members present. The mayor asked him to make an appearance as a show of community support, not for any official police business. That, of course, didn’t stop him from taking in the sights so to speak. 

He recollected how subdued the other members present seemed at the time, a shared look on their faces of suppressed anxiety. It wasn’t obvious. It was there and gone, the way you only catch the glimpse of a shooting star out of the corner of your eye and never straight on. Today he was just here for the groundbreaking ceremony, but he had an unshakeable feeling that he’d be back, speaking to them behind closed doors about the things they saw out of the corners of their eyes but couldn’t speak of. 
</p>
<br> 
<br> 
 
<h2>Chapter 2 – What Victor saw </h2>
<br> 
<h3><em>Two Years later....</em></h3>

<br> 
<br> 

 
<p class="maintext">
The plant was finally up and running (though still in the research phase) and it needed workers to fill it. One man was particularly excited to get a call from the staffing agency in town. Victor, a former mechanic, had been out of work for months after the owner sold the business (to settle gambling debts according to the other mechanics). He remembered the signed HR form on his kitchen table said he would be a “Coolant Supply Engineer I.” He only had the vaguest idea of what the title meant, but the agency assured him that he was what they were looking for. 
<br> 
“Well Vick, they’re looking for mechanics and engineers of all backgrounds, and the pay looks pretty good,” the fast-talking agency rep said over the phone. 
<br> 
“If you can tighten a bolt and follow directions, they want to talk to you.” 
<br> 
Of course, Victor had far more experience than that. Back home he and his cousin repurposed old or “found” car parts. He had a working knowledge of 9 different engine layouts across more than thirty models by the time he was 17. This same hobby that would nearly get him deported as a teenager could now be “repurposed” for providing clean energy to citizens of Harmony and 6 neighboring counties. He had grown up, and with a new wedding ring on his finger he was a model employee. He wore his ID badge proudly every day to work. “Engineer I” it read. Perhaps someday he would go back to school and become a real engineer with the blessings of the company. Of course, he thought that’s if they don’t let him go first for being crazy. 

Now just two hours into his shift the Sheriff is sitting across from him at a cold metal table in the break room. He is looking at him with the same expression of sympathy and disbelief that his supervisor had just hours earlier, but for a completely different reason. 

The Sheriff pulled a small voice recorder from his pocket and placed it on the table in front of him. 
<br> 
“I’m not going to turn this on just yet, because you and me need to get to know each other first.” 
<br> 
Victor let out a nervous laugh. 
<br> 
“What is this about? I already gave a statement.” 
<br> 
The Sheriff pulled out the statement and placed it on the table with care, almost daintily. 
<br> 
“And I read every word of it. I just want to understand what it all means. All this technical jargon...I’m a simple, country law man. Just tell me if I have my facts straight.” 
<br> 
Victor shifted in his chair nervously. The Sheriff pretended not to notice. 
<br> 
“Now they tell me that you were directly responsible for halting a pretty, major experiment this morning just as it was about to get underway. They all seem pretty sore about that Mr...um...hmm.” The Sheriff gave a brief look of surprise at the paper but then quickly recovered. 
<br> 
“Anzules! Of course, Mr. Anzules I meant to say. Did I say it right?” 
<br> 
Victor gave a surprised smile.  
<br> 
“Yes, you said it perfectly. No one ever does out here.” 
<br> 
The Sheriff’s jovial smile faded seamlessly into a blank expression. 
<br> 
“What happened in that chamber this morning? You’re one of the safety officers I hear. That means you have every authority to stop the operation if things go south. Either you saw something the others didn’t, or you sensed something they couldn’t.” 
<br> 
Victor broke eye contact again and stared at the recorder. 
<br> 
“Shouldn’t you start the recorder?” 

<br> 
The Sheriff loosened his tie and leaned back in the chair. 
<br> 
“Good man. Not yet, we’ll get to that. Now speak son.” 
<br> 
He rubbed his hands on his knees, sighed deeply, and began his story from the beginning. 
<br> 
“Today’s experiment was basically a dress rehearsal for a full run...that’s where we initiate a full reaction cycle and measure the energy output at the end. There are three safety officers stationed along the control tower during experiments.” 
<br> 
“Why three?” The Sheriff interrupted. 
<br> 
“Three different vantage points, above, below, and near testing level. That way we can ensure that the testing grounds are clear. I was at testing level monitoring the temperature when I spotted someone on the bridge. The area should’ve been clear. The doors were already locked and pressurized. That area would essentially be a vacuum. Best case scenario they’d suffocate before we can get them out.” 
<br> 
“And the worst case?” 
<br> 
“If the reaction started with him inside you mean? He’d be vaporized...literally. Every molecule he owned would be reduced to ions before his eyes could even squint from the glare.”   
<br> 
“Sweet mercy! Well, that’s no room I wanna be in." 
<br>
“Exactly! I hit the alarm, got on the radio to the other officers about what I saw and...” 
<br>
The Sheriff interrupted. 
<br>
“And he was gone...a 6’5”tall, handsome, Middle Eastern-looking fellow of college age, and no one else saw him.” 
<br>
Victor gave a drawn-out sigh of frustration, shaking his head from side to side. 
<br>
“Yeah, no one else saw him.” 
<br>
The Sheriff leaned forward with a rather mischievous look on his face that Victor had trouble reading. 
<br>
“And that’s all you saw?” 
<br>
Victor slammed both fists on the table. 
<br>
“Look I saw him ok! Just as I can see you in front of me.” 
<br>
The Sheriff threw his palms out in front of him in a calming, defensive way. 
<br>
“Oh no son, you don’t understand. I believe you. I’m probably the only one in this creepy-ass building that believes every word you’ve said, but you see I think you’ve left something out of your description. I would know because I’ve heard it before.” 
<br>
The Sheriff picked up the recorder and played with it in his hand a moment as if he could sense the physical weight of what it had to say. 
<br>
“I didn’t bring this to record you, Victor. I wanted you to hear something.” 
<br>
For the next few minutes, the Sheriff played clips of a series of eyewitness interviews that he had conducted over the past year. Each interview described in detail (some more than others) the very person Victor had seen earlier that day. Victor listened intently with a mixture of validation and terror. 

When he’d listened to all of them, the Sheriff returned the recorder to his inside coat pocket, leaned back again in his chair, and folded his arms. 
<br>
“So, Victor, now that you know I don’t think you’re crazy, why don’t you go ahead and tell me the rest of it?” 
<br>
“Like what?”
<br> 
He gave that same nervous shuffle in his seat. He had no idea how noticeable his ‘tells’ were the Sheriff remembered thinking. 
<br>
‘Like tell me how you saw this guy leave the chamber. You know, I think the reason the others couldn’t see this intruder is because he didn’t leave the way he came in, and of course how could that happen in a room with only one vacuum sealed door?” 
<br>
Victor gave a sigh of reluctance and then looked the Sheriff in the eyes for the first time. 
<br>
“Because he walked through the wall.” 
<br>
The Sheriff nodded slowly and gave a slight smile at this admission. 
<br>
“And what was he carrying with him?” 
<br>
“Nothing. He didn’t have...anything.” 
<br>
Again, the Sheriff nodded approvingly, as if he were a professor trying to draw the answers out of his student, as was his way. 
<br>
“Exactly, he had nothing, and he took nothing. He merely made an appearance in front of the one person who could shut the whole thing down.” 
<br>
Victor said nothing for quite some time, merely shook his head to either side in concerned disbelief.
<br>
"Sheriff I...don't really know what to think about all this."
<br>
The Sheriff smiled and began placing the papers back in his worse for wear leather bag.
<br>
"Do you smoke Victor? That's ok, I don't either. I kinda wish we did. I think that's what people do when reality gets too unreal, they lean on their lesser vices"
<br>
The Sheriff noticed Victor's attention straying out the breakroom window to where his Supervisor and a manager were standing in the hallway, not so inconspicuously peeping in on their interview. It was at that moment the Sheriff pulled him in closer.
<br>
"Can those pricks hear us?"
<br>
"I don't think so, this room is pretty sound proof"
<br>
"Then if you want to keep your job do what I say. In 3 seconds we're both going to start laughing like we're the best of friends. We're going to stand up together, heartily shake hands, and you're going to walk me past them and into the elevator down."
<br>
They did so, and just as the imposing pair cast a curious gaze at Victor, the Sheriff remarked just loud enough for them to hear "You've really been a huge help Victor! We've been looking for this guy for some time now." 
<br>
The elevator doors closed and the Sheriff resumed business.
<br>
"I just did you a favor. Now you can earn that compliment"
<br>
"But how?"
<br>
Victor was standing with his back against the elevator, arms folded as if everything he didn't understand was slowly freezing him to death.
<br> 

For an answer the Sheriff removed the small envelope from his coat pocket containing the pieces of glass he’d found by the lake that morning and handed it to Victor. As he opened the envelope and examined the pieces a look of shock and familiarity flashed over his face. 

<br> 

 

“You’ve seen something like these before? Show me.” 
</p>
<br> 

<br> 

 

<h3>A few weeks earlier...</h3> 

<br> 

<br> 

<p class="maintext"> 

“I’m telling you Toby, it’s gotta be military experimentation! I’m talking about off the books stuff; complete with clandestine government agents, black helicopters, and all that shit.” 

<br> 

 

Teddy, or “Theodora” to her family was even more worked up that day than deputy Hopkins was used to. She was the primary lookout at the Northern Slope fire tower. It sat on the shoulders of the highest peak like a gargoyle looking out over Harmony and the Miskwà reserve. She was something of a meteorology buff, a conspiracy theorist, and coincidentally Hopkins’s aunt. He had been concerned about her “isolation” lately. 

<br> 

 

“Alright Teddy, what’s all this about? I’ve got a lot of stops this afternoon and you aren’t exactly in the neighborhood.” 

<br> 

 

She grabbed his arm with what he always thought was an alarmingly stiff grip and led him over to a large oak table. A massive topographic map was layed out, marked in four places with little red lightning bolts. He also observed a fifth position on the map marked with a question mark. Before he could ask Teddy put her hands on his shoulders with a look of apprehensive energy. 

<br> 

 

“Have you heard anything new about the fifth hiker?” 

<br> 

 

Hopkins’s face flushed with nervous agitation as he stepped back from the table. 

<br> 

 

“Teddy, how on Earth did you hear about that?!” 

<br> 

 

Her look of concern switched in an instant to a satisfied smile. She then pulled a red colored pencil from her shirt pocket, rubbed away the odd question mark on the map with her thumb, and drew a bold lightning bolt in its place. Hopkins grabbed her hand sternly. 

<br> 

 

“Listen Teddy, this is an active missing person’s case. If you know something, then you need to...” 

<br> 

 

She silenced him with four fingers to his lips, picked up a remote control and pressed play on a CCTV monitor overhead, which she had cued up for his arrival. He sat and impatiently watched as the screen displayed 5 images at once. They were all video feeds of the valley at 1500 feet, capturing what appeared to be thunderstorms. She then froze each video at the very moment lightning had struck. Hopkins let out a frustrated sigh. 

<br> 

 

“I mean it is quite impressive that you managed to capture this footage on that outdated camera, but what does any of this have to do with the hikers?” 

<br> 

 

Agitated, she tossed the remote into his lap and wandered over to an electric kettle propped up on milk crates in the corner. 

<br> 

 

“Don’t be so two-dimensional. Look at the damn time stamps! See anything familiar?” 

<br> 

 

He did so, and after a moment he stared at Teddy in bewildered amazement.  

<br> 

 

“These clips of yours were all recorded around the times each hiker went missing.” 

<br> 

 

Teddy handed him an Oakland Raider’s mug filled with instant hot chocolate (2 packs just how he liked it). 

<br> 

 

“Those ‘outdated’ cameras outside are connected to Wi-Fi so the date and time are always current before you ask. No Toby, I think you’re looking at the very moments when those folks went missing.” 

<br> 

 

He ran his finger along the five points on the map, each corresponding to the five scenes he and the Sheriff investigated. He could still see the scorched earth in his mind; remembered that faint sulfur smell, like fresh lit July 4th sparklers. He didn’t quite know what to think at that moment, least of all what to say. Things seemed to be adding up that shouldn’t. Lightning bolts don’t abduct people. You can’t cross-examine thunderstorms.  

<br> 

 

Teddy had migrated over to one of the massive full-length widows. She was watching the last of the season’s sparrows pick at the bird seed she had left for them. In the space of that still moment, perhaps out of a desperate need for normalcy, Hopkins broke the silence. 

<br> 

 

“You know when I go to town I fill up on coffee at Minor’s Tavern. Edison asks about you.” 

<br> 

 

Teddy rolled her eyes and gave a smirk at his mischievous reflection in the window. 

<br> 

 

“He most certainly does not...grumpy ole cuss.”  

<br> 

 

She said with a comical frankness. Hopkins just laughed and shook his head.  

<br> 

 

“Well, I know he means to.” 

<br> 

 

This familiar lightness between them wouldn’t last, however. There were deep, dark questions in the air that made the sunlit tower feel overcast and haunted with significance.  

<br> 

 

“Listen Teddy, I’ll admit that these late-night flashes in the sky are a very peculiar coincidence, but are we really hinting that lightning has anything at all to do with these people disappearing?” 

<br> 

 

She shifted her eyes away from the birds to the cluster of maples in the valley below surrounding Lake Miskwà. 

<br> 

 

“I’m a batty old woman who stares at the tops of trees all day and most nights. I’ve seen hundreds of storms. They bring down trees, start floods and spark fires. It’s all nature’s cycle, of course, but there was nothing natural about that lightning on those nights.” 

<br> 

 

Hopkins perked up. 

<br> 

 

“What do you mean it won’t natural?” 

<br> 

 

She turned to look at him.  

<br> 

 

“That lightning came on its own; no wind, not a speck of rain, and my barometers barely flinched. That doesn’t happen. They say lightning never strikes twice in the same place, I don’t know how true that is, but it always strikes at least twice.” 

<br> 

 

She turned to Hopkins with a pause as if something else had just come to mind. There was a tall wooden stool at the other end of the oak table on which sat an old sugar cookie tin, the kind you see in everyone’s household, but rarely with sugar cookies in them. She gestured to him to open it. A modest pile of beautifully browned oatmeal raisin cookies was inside. Though they were more like chunks or morsels than cookies. Hopkins’s eyes widened as if he’d just found Incan treasure with Dr. Jones in the jungle. He grabbed one of the clusters, breathed in the warm cinnamon, the bitter-sweet char of butter and sugar. 

<br> 

 

She grabbed it out of his hand right before biting down, placed it on a napkin in front of him, and carefully stacked four more cookies on top to further illustrate her point. 

<br> 

 

“Not storms Toby, a single bolt of lightning for every hiker gone. Five hikers, five strikes. Or will it take six before your crazy Aunt is no longer talking out her ass?” 

<br> 

 

“You and I are whispering about phenomena, Auntie. Our humble branch of Southwest Virginia law enforcement simply will not accommodate the lengthy trial of a weather pattern. You and I both know what’s next if we don’t find a hiker, a suspect, or a witness. They’ll dismiss it; ‘natural causes with no indication of foul play.’ In other words, an act of God.” 

<br> 

 

She swallowed her cookie in two bites and walked back over to the monitor. 

<br> 

 

“You want suspects? Fine. There’s something going on at that lake and that sketch-ass plant and I’ve got a good eye on both.” 

<br> 

 

Grabbing the remote she played one last feed. This one from the South-facing side of the fire tower. The large concrete columns of the power plant were just barely visible. The lightning in the foreground behaved the same as before, but this time she zoomed in on the plant where another kind of lightning, it seemed, originated. 

<br> 

Hopkins cookie fell and crumbled onto the floor. The Sheriff answered after the 3rd ring. 

<br> 

“Sheriff, there’s something you should see.”
</p> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Chapter 3 - Meeting Agent Rutger</h2>

<br>
<br>
<p class="maintext">
My head was spinning after leaving Hopkins at the fire station that afternoon. The time stamped video footage of lightning syncing up to the date and time of each disappearance felt like a discovery, like holding a missing piece, but to what puzzle? 
<br>
Pieces were fitting together somehow but they weren’t forming any picture, and yet I felt as though I was in fact learning something. What did the plant have to do with it; nothing or everything? Aside from a few freaky lights caught on poorly pixelated camera images. I had nothing substantial to go banging on their doors about. Of course, who’s to say they won’t reach out to me first. 
<br>
Of course, I can’t say my Fire tower visit was completely wasted. That map of Teddy’s along with the clever markings she’d made tickled my curiosity a great deal. There was one point on the map she’d overlooked, a missing person she wouldn’t have known about. His case wasn’t mentioned in the news with the others. He wasn’t even a hiker, and yet all the other points seemed to form a jagged circle around the spot where he went missing, Arnold’s Pier. 
<br>
Hard to say what I was doing out there that next morning. I couldn’t sleep and Miskwà was only a 7-minute drive. “Couldn’t sleep” is putting it lightly. For weeks it felt like all my nightmares had been written and directed by the Devil himself. One dream kept leading me to the same place in the same moment. 
<br>
I’m running down the boardwalk of an old pier. My lungs are burning in the cold, and I don’t know what I’m trying to catch up to, but I reach the water and there he is, Malcolm Reese (the 1st missing person). He’s being suspended in the air just 3 feet above the water’s surface like a G.I. Joe action figure. He sees me but can’t move, mouth wide open trying to scream, but no voice to carry it.  
<br>
And I can’t move. Something is holding me back; powerful, ancient, and emotionless. And it’s coming from the Goddamn water! I know it is, but I don’t know how I know. Sure, his file says he’s 22 yrs. old but his eyes are 5 yrs. old, still afraid of the dark. 
<br>
As I fought against my invisible shackles I watched helplessly as an empty sphere of light sucked him into an unknown hell one atom at a time. 
<br>
So, armed with a McMuffin, my service pistol, and my day off sweatpants I wandered through the morning dew to Arnold’s pier that day. It had been 3 months since Malcolm disappeared and I’m revisiting a cold scene with no idea what I’m looking for. 
<br>
Malcolm’s case was fundamentally different than the others. While he may have disappeared by the water like the others, it is well known that his behavior changed drastically in the hours leading up to his disappearance. 
<br>
I knew him. He’s gone for a ride in my squad car more than once for shoplifting and petty theft while he was in Highschool. We were all glad to see him get his shit together eventually, securing an apprenticeship with an electrician through Carver Community College. 
<br>
That Friday he and his mentor, Bishop were checking solar panel connections on the roof of the new fitness center downtown. Bishop left him to finish up while he headed down to the lobby for coffee. Ten minutes later there was a resounding boom heard throughout the building. Bishop and the front desk manager snatched an AED from the wall and hauled ass to the roof as fast as his 52 yr. old knees could get him there.   Sure enough, Malcolm was sprawled out by an air conditioning duct blinking hard, eyes to the horizon. He was dazed, still gripping a pair of needle nose pliers with his gloved right hand. He had no clue what happened, only that it got so eerily cloudy at one point that he reached for the flashlight on his keychain. Before he knew it, he was on the ground. As they got him to his feet the concrete was scorched underneath him. His steel toe work boots were kicked off to the side, soaking wet. 
<br>
They got Malcolm into the passenger seat of Bishop’s truck where he waited while Bishop made one last sweep of the roof for live wires or faulty connections, which he never found. When he returned, Malcolm was gone.  
<br>
Two loggers were tying down their cargo along the old service road about a quarter mile away. They called the park ranger when they spotted a “tall, young guy in gray coveralls walking barefoot down the gravel path talking to himself.” He was headed in the direction of Arnold’s pier. That would be the last time anyone saw Malcolm. 
<br>
<br>
Now there I was, standing at the end of the pier. A flock of waterfowl took flight suddenly from the surface of the water, an area that looked much deeper or at least darker. It formed a barely perceivable ring of black water that seemed to churn counter to the flow of the stream that fed it. My eyes fixed on that point in the distance. Perhaps the water was churning about the branches of a fallen, submerged tree or the buried, abandoned architecture of long departed beavers. However, the overall shape was far too defined to be caused by something natural. Leaving the pier, I moved along the bank to get a better look. Not far from this spot was a massive sycamore with wide branches like arms outstretched over the water.  
<br>
I wriggled up the tree trunk, regretting the unforeseen burden extra hashbrowns and black coffee would place on my morning’s adventure. Where were the birds, the squirrels, the croaking of frogs through the lake mist? There was an unsettling absence of life in what would otherwise be a picturesque setting.  I heard my thoughts, echoing and intrusive like a separate voice. It said, “wait here a minute and let’s see.” 
<br>
Though the tree gave me a better vantage point, the formless shape in the water was no less dark and obscure. Suddenly, an odd overcast formed from clouds along the bank, as if a thunderstorm were descending only on this sycamore. 
<br>
I’ve no eye for storms like Teddy, but these clouds moved in an almost automated way. They were converging on my location in an unmistakable formation. So hypnotized with dreadful wonder at the thing that I almost completely lost sight of the water below.  The dark ring, or perhaps a disk; no, a platform taking shape among the swirling clouds of ancient silt. That was when it dawned on me that the clouds were meeting at this point, this form in the water. Was this dark choreography of elements meant for me? How could this... 
<br>
My thoughts were interrupted in a flash with a flash. A blinding blue-white glare saturated my field of vision with a white-hot snow blindness. I was seized by a paralyzing sensation that transcends every experience or description of pain. It was energy, raw and elemental, pulsing through my spine, setting every pimple, fingernail, and hair follicle ablaze. 
<br>
Was I still in a tree, underwater, or floating just above its surface? None of that felt relevant. I was being forced to participate in something and I, a 5’8”, 215-pound armed officer of the law had no choice but to comply. 
<br>
Don’t know if I was passing out or dying, but the last thing I saw before my eyes closed was a pair of headlights by the pier. I regained consciousness briefly as a nurse struggled to insert an IV in my arm. Then an unfamiliar voice... 
<br>
“You know if you drank more water and less gas station coffee, you’d make reviving you a lot easier.” As he came closer, I saw his face. 
<br>
“Well Sheriff, you’ve got to be the luckiest son of a bitch in Augusta County. He put a warm hand on my shoulder. “I’m Special Agent Rutger. We have so much to talk about.”  
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
<h2>Chapter 4 - The “Other” FBI...</h2> 
<br>
<br>

<p class="maintext">
They'd given me a navy-blue, one-piece jumpsuit to wear with "cadet" stitched in bold white letters on the left lapel. My clothes were no doubt still soaked in lake water. I don't seem to be in custody and apparently, I'm "free to leave" which is laughable considering that I haven't the faintest clue where I am.  
<br>
I'm in a small, unfurnished room with freshly painted gray walls except for the wall facing me whose top portion is tinted glass. I’m seated at a comically large wooden table drinking a cup of surprisingly excellent coffee. It had occurred to me that I probably shouldn't eat or drink anything they offer me, but a lifelong addict like me is always one missed cup away from a splitting headache. 
<br>
On the other side of the glass was a well-built, clean-shaven, Men in Black looking character. I would guess him to be in his early thirties, and yet despite his youthful face there was that telltale look of loss in his eyes that convinced me that he was a man of experience, dark experiences. 
<br>
He explained how the room itself was quite state of the art. Sensors imbedded in the table and chair measure pulse rate, body heat and skin conductivity. That, of course, was nothing compared to what the walls could do. It was primarily used to interrogate Jihadists, screen witnesses, and soldiers suspected of having been radicalized. In my case “you’ve made contact with the anomaly, and we’d like to monitor you for your safety and ours.” Regardless, I played along, because I wanted to know what they seemed to know. 
<br>
<br> 

“How does this work, I just talk?” 
<br>
Agent Rutger – “Yes Sir, and no need to project. The room’s acoustic A.I. will sync with your vocal pattern. So, just speak naturally.”  
<br>
His voice was projected through a barely noticeable oval shaped speaker protruding through the tinted glass. 
<br>
“Wow you guys have all the fancy tech out in Quantico 
<br>
Rutger – “Indeed Sir, but again this isn’t Quantico. We’re not far but, this location is...dark.” 
<br>
“Dark huh? Well, all the same you’re clearly government funded and connected to the bureau.” 
<br>
Rutger - “And how do you know that?  
<br>
“Nothing much to go on really. Last night I caught a glimpse of the back of my nurse’s clipboard , ‘Fidelity, Bravery and Integrity’ which is the bureau’s motto I believe. It was a new clipboard. So, they no doubt regularly supply this facility with all the comforts of home, to include standard issue Glock 17 side arms. You’ve been rubbing your left shoulder all morning...must be a new holster. It’s alright if you want to adjust it.” 
<br>
Agent Rutger smiled, shook his head, and took his jacket off momentarily to loosen the leather shoulder strap. 
<br>
Rutger - "For now Sheriff, just think of us as an unofficial archive.”  
<br>
I had to laugh. “Right, you guys are just super intense librarians.” 
<br>
Rutger - “For everyone found, there are five times as many lost. Think of all the unsolved cases, unrecovered bodies, missing evidence, and unanswered questions. We sift through countless files, recordings, cardboard boxes, and Ziplock bags to examine all the sins and secrets people try their best to forget. It was inevitable that we would stumble upon more and more “sensitive” cases. Cold cases involving politicians, foreign nationals, and classified et Ceteras necessitated higher and higher security clearances. Ultimately, the bureau saw no other alternative but to grant us a secure space of our own.” 
<br>
“I think I understand where you’re going with this. You and your archivists are adequately set up for investigating unexplained “anomalies” as you put  it. Now you want to know exactly what I saw to file it away."                                                                                                                                                                                 
<br>
Rutger - "Well, you're half right Sheriff. We do investigate anomalies, but we're not actually interested in what you saw. No disrespect intended, but we know what you saw and felt. I certainly don't want to waste your time convincing you that any of it was real."
<br>
"I'm not sure I follow..."
<br>
Rutger - "You and I both know that not every witness is as valid or valuable as they think, but sometimes people have valuable information and don't realize it. Sheriff we believe that you can be very valuable in this way."
<br>
I walked over to the window and extended a hand. He got the joke and likewise stood from behind the glass and pretended to shake mine.
<br>
"I'll tell you a bedtime story if you tell me one."
<br>
He gestured politely for me to take a seat at the table once again.
<br>
Rutger - "How did you meet Dr. Holmes and what do you know about his project?"
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>A Recollection...</h3> 
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<p class="maintext">
It was the coldest part of winter out here, mid-February. Yet, there she was standing barefoot at the tree line of Dr. Holmes’s property. It couldn’t have been more than 35 degrees outside, but she’s just standing, staring into space wearing nothing more than tattered, mud-speckled blue jeans and field hockey jersey. She was completely out of it, or as H0lmes described in his statement, “she was motionless and emotionless.”  

<br> 

It was Holmes of course, who discovered the girl and called it in thinking some Meth head had wandered out of the woods. However, when we got there Dr. Holmes was unconscious on the grass within arm's reach of the girl. Two EMTs carried Holmes and the girl off to the hospital. I appointed Deputy Larson as security overwatch. Dr. Holmes, it is said, came to his senses the next morning in ICU in a very “excited” state. His attending nurse claims that seconds after opening his eyes he sprang upright in bed and demanded a legal pad, a pen, and his discharge papers. He was of course held for questioning. 

<br> 

According to Holmes, he spotted the girl that morning from his kitchen window. He admits to not heeding the dispatcher’s advice to not approach the girl until first responders arrive. He says he was compelled to bring the girl a blanket and slippers because, “junkie or not I couldn’t just watch a young girl freeze while buttering a waffle.” As Dr. Holmes approached the girl calling out to her with no response (she was staring directly up into the sky). When he touched her shoulder, the girl let out a shriek, turned, grabbed Holmes's shoulders with an extraordinary strength he didn’t think possible from such an emaciated youth. He claims that as he tried to calm the girl, she stared (pupils fully dilated) into his eyes mumbling indiscernible phrases over and over again. He described her voice as unnatural, almost far away and distorted by static. It was at that point Holmes felt an intense shock go through his whole body. He described the experience as “like being electrocuted.”  At first, he thought the girl had tased him. The deputies and EMTs searched the girl, and no weapon or toxin of any kind were ever recovered. 

<br> 

 

The girl, 14 yr. old Jayda Sequoyah (or “Little Sparrow” of the Eastern Cherokee Nation) was reported missing by her parents 5 days prior to the incident. She had run away once before. A gifted artist in her own right, she once tried hitchhiking to D.C. where she planned to draw murals for a protest against her parents’ wishes, of course. 

<br> 

 

She was famished and dehydrated, with no physical signs of abuse. No one could assess where she came from. The patch of woods near Dr. Holmes’s property could be easily traversed in under twenty minutes. Her toxicology report was uneventful, aside from the all too typical small-town traces of nicotine and cannibus. She had pitifully low blood sugar, but no neurological abnormalities, and yet according to Dr. Onwukwe (the child psychologist), Jayda was completely disconnected from reality.  

<br> 
<br>
 

Rutger – Sheriff, were you present during any of Dr. Onwukwe’s sessions with the girl? 
<br>
No, I was tying up other loose ends in the case. They told me the girl was recovered but had no memory of the details of her disappearance. So, we questioned her friend Kendra who attended St. Augustine School with Jayda and she reluctantly filled us in on some of the details of her disappearance days earlier.  

<br> 

 <br>

Rutger – She was a witness? 

<br> 

 <br>

He asked with what the Sheriff felt was a surprising amount of interest. 

<br> 

 <br>

Sheriff – Well, not exactly. They apparently slipped off campus during lunch hour to smoke weed along the East bank of Miskwà, which is only a short walk through the woods. They heard the loud boom of thunder nearby at which point they took off running. Kendra thought it would be funny to grab hold of Jayda’s backpack and sprint ahead of her, fully expecting her friend who was the much faster runner on account of her height, to follow close behind. Kendra made it back to the school with Jayda nowhere in sight. After recovering six, frantic “Where the Hell are you?!” voice messages from Jayda’s phone records, Kendra’s story seemed legitimate enough. 

Agent Rutger no longer thumbing through papers was looking directly at me, perhaps for the first time. 

<br> 

 <br>

Rutger – I understand. We have recovered Dr. Onwukwe’s official transcript of that case, along with her professional and private notes on the matter. I’d like to share those with you now. 

<br> 

He passed a dark blue folder through the slotted opening in the window.

On the rare moments when she does speak directly to me it is to reference the ‘storm people.’ Jayda is 14 yrs old, a very independent gifted child on the very border of adolescence. I was concerned therefore that if she had been abducted and abused then she was retreating into this childlike description. However, she showed no signs of aggression, discomfort, fear or shame. She answered my questions bluntly, without any emotional arousal.  

<br> 

In fact, at times it was as if I was not speaking to Jayda but rather through her. However, on the third and final day of her altered mental state which she would fully recover from, I witnessed a psychological phenomenon that I have never encountered in my whole professional career.

Interview Transcript 

<br> 
<br>

Me - Good afternoon, Jayda. How are you feeling? They tell me you haven’t eaten. 

<br>
<br>

Jayda – Where is the scientist? 

<br> 
<br>
(It was her voice that shocked me more than her question, because it was not that of a child, but two distinct voices speaking in unison.) 

<br> 
<br>
Me – You mean Dr. Holmes? He was injured. He is recovering in another wing of this hospital. Do you know what happened to him Jayda? 

<br> 
<br>
Jayda – We miscalculated. 

<br> 

(She said ‘we.’ This was new. I’ll adjust I thought.) 
<br>
<br> 

Me – You miscalculated? You didn’t mean to hurt him? 

<br> 
<br>
Jayda – Of course not. We underestimated the weakness of his vessel. 

<br> 

<br> 

Me – Who am I speaking with right now? 

<br> 
<br>
Jayda – Can we see the scientist? 

<br> 
<br>
Me – I'm afraid not. He is recovering, but he will be alright. Do you need to tell him something? 

<br> 
<br>
Jayda – We already have. 
<br>
<br> 

Me – Who are you? Who am I speaking to right now? 

<br> 

(I insisted with a much firmer tone) 

<br> 
<br>
Jayda – We are from this Earth, but not of this world. Do not try to comprehend. The dimensions of your physical world are infinitely more complex than your primitive science will allow you to understand. 

<br> 

(She has completely retreated from her own identity inside this fantasy in self-defense. There must certainly be a long story of trauma behind this to have developed so sophisticated a construct.) 
<br>
<br> 

Me – What do you want with Jayda? 

<br> 

(I decided to switch tactics. I will play along and negotiate with her constructed self) 
<br>
<br> 

Jayda – This vessel is growing weak. 
<br>
<br>
Me – You need to eat...or rather, the vessel requires food to live and thrive. 

<br> 

(There was a long silence at this point, and I fought the urge to break it. Here eyes were darting unnaturally from side to side while her posture remained perfectly still. It was as if she were on standby downloading the information I had just given her.) 

<br> 
<br>
Jayda – We understand. And the scientist, will he thrive? 

<br> 

(I had sent a text to Deputy Larson. He finally replied with a 10 second video of Dr. Holmes eating pancakes at his bed tray which I presented to Jayda.) 

<br> 
<br>
Jayda – Very well. We return your vessel. 

<br> 

(At this, Jayda’s body went limp and she collapsed onto the floor. I and a nurse’s aide helped her into a chair. She blinked several times, and it was like meeting Jayda for the first time. She was disoriented, ravenously hungry, and suddenly very embarrassed to find that she had been stripped down to her underwear and placed in a hospital gown. She was completely self-aware again, like any normal adolescent should be, much to my relief and confusion. Though confused, Jayda displayed no indications of shame or fear. None of my professional instincts led me to think that any real harm had come to this child, and yet what “on Earth” could account for her extraordinary behavior?  

<br> 
<br>
Back home in Nigeria as children we heard stories of Emere, a child who could travel between this world and the spirit world. I am, of course, far removed from the mythical traditions of my people now. However, Jayda is Cherokee on her father's side, and though she does not show great interest in her cultural traditions (to her father’s disappointment), she was still exposed to the stories just as I was. They have surely worked themselves into her subconscious. And yet, this does not explain...everything.    

<br> 

After breaking the seemingly tragic news(for a teenager) that her cell phone was never found I let her know that Dr. Holmes would be discharged soon, to which she responded, “Am I supposed to know who he is or something?” 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="maintext"> 
Now I was the one shifting nervously in my chair. I’ve never had a piece of paper fill me with more foreboding and dread than this Doctors' report. Here we are, two seasoned members of law enforcement talking about aliens without saying “aliens.” Agent Rutger gave me a knowing glance. 

<br> 
<br>
Rutger – You must have many questions. 
<br>
<br>
Sheriff – You told me that you “recovered” Dr. Onwukwe’s notes. How did you get them? Did you steal them or something? There’s no way a competent, star psychologist like Onwukwe would ever just part with her personal notes and breach the confidentiality of her patient. 

<br> 

Agent Rutger gave a slight smile in appreciation of the Sheriff’s observation. 

<br> 
<br>
Rutger – The notes were given to us as evidence in a separate missing person case, that of Dr. Onwukwe herself. She had been planning a homecoming trip back to Nigeria for several months and to participate in her hometown’s local elections. However, Dr. Onwukwe never checked in at the Benin airport. Traffic control lost communication with a 10-person plane during a strong electrical storm that hadn’t appeared on radar up to that point. 

<br>
It was that same feeling I had in the fire tower, just another mystery wearing the perfume of a revelation.
<br>
Rutger - We'll get to all that soon enough. For now, how did you first learn about Dr. Holmes's project? Surely you two talked when he wasn't unconscious.
<br>
<br>
"Well I was getting to that."
<br>
<br>
I raised my empty coffee to the window with as innocent a smile as I could manage. Rutger smirked, made a quick call on his cell phone, and moments later a woman entered the room he was in. They briefly exchanged words of which she seemed to have the last of. Placing a a freshly filled cup of cofee by the slot she gave me a curious gaze of quiet analysis and immediate dismisal,and left us. There was no cream or sugar this time. How apropos I thought.
<br>
<br>
"So, the section chiefs bring you coffee here. How do I apply?"
<br>
<br> 
He sighed at this sardonic remark like a tired parent.
<br>
<br>
Rutger - I believe you were about to regale me with how you met Dr. Holmes and learned of his experiment, during his waking hours of course.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Chapter 5 - The Experiment</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p class="maintext">

    I wasn’t just at the plant that day for the press conference. I was called in to look into some vandalism at the site, hours before the mayor asked if I would be there. Someone had tampered with one of the plant’s main security gates. Daily operations were delayed for about 2hrs because no one could access the vital areas of the plant or any of the heavy equipment staring at them from the other side of the $20,000, 15ft gate that wouldn’t budge. 
<br>
    It didn’t take long to see what was holding back the gate. Clamped to the bars, nearly three feet from the keypad entry (and just out of sight of the camera) were two red and black jumper cables. These led about a meter away to a portable gas-powered generator toppled over on the ground. Crude but effective, if their only intention was merely to cause a delay. They didn’t seem to care about breaking in, considering that they abandoned this rig to run all night, even though it would clearly take half that time to overload the gate’s circuitry.

    I discussed these things with the project foreman who, on my request, showed me around the area these gates were built to protect. Our path took us past a neatly manicured lawn and common space. That day a local food truck was let in. There was a small patch of newly planted ornamental shrubs with park benches forming a circle around them where several employees in hard hats and lab coats alike were eating massive tacos and gorditas on floppy paper plates. 
    <br>
    “People are pretty happy here. They’re good to us,” said the foreman almost answering my daydreaming gaze at this refreshingly utopian workplace. 
    <br>
    “Seems that way don’t it. Of course, those fellas over there look like they could use a taco.” I nodded at the huddle of security officers back at the gate having what appeared to be a State of the Union style discussion about the recent breech. I had no interest in adding my two cents and nudged the foreman to lead me on. 
    <br>
    We eventually reached an enormous cylindrical building. As we walked through the front sliding doors, I was perplexed at seeing that the entrance lead just a few feet to the curved concrete wall of the building, a dead end. I felt the foreman smiling before I ever turned to look at him. 
    <br>
    Foreman – “Sorry to alarm you Sheriff, but this never gets old. Do me a favor and take a step back from that wall.”  
    <br>
    At this he scanned his badge at the keypad and after 3 loud beeps two large metal doors slid noiselessly together, closing us off from the glass entrance. In a moment I felt the room jolt into that familiar elevator motion. 
    <br>
    “A bit showy for tax dollars if you ask me.” 
    <br>
    He just kept looking at the metal doors in front of him and smiled. 
    <br>
    Foreman - “Tax dollars barely pay the landscapers here. Wealthy donors make the floors move. The way I hear it, there’s more than 15 countries throwing quarters into this piggy bank.”  
    <br>
    We reached another floor with a separate set of metal doors that opened onto a network of long, steel catwalks and stairs leading to tiny offices the size and shape of ticket booths. We were at a dizzying height of what felt like 10 stories. 
    <br>
    Foreman - “Those rooms around us are for monitoring the experiment below in the bolt chamber...for studying lightning or something. Hell if I know, I just manage the construction on the outside.” 
    <br>
    I stopped him and put a hand on his shoulder. 
    <br>
    “Did you say lightning? Now what on Earth does that have to do with a nuclear fusion plant I wonder?”  
    <br>
    Just then I heard a familiar voice in the distance. 
    <br>
    “At this moment, everything Sheriff.” 
    <br>
    This was added by Dr. Holmes himself as he left one of the observation towers and scaled the narrow metal stairs to meet us. The foreman paused as if looking to Holmes for instruction.  
    <br>
    Holmes - That’s alright Nabu, I don’t mind filling the Sheriff in on particulars. How are you, Sheriff? It’s been some time since our first, unfortunate introduction. 
    <br>
    “You look well Doctor.” At this he skipped the last of the metal steps and landed with a jovial spring of energy. 
    <br>
    Holmes - I’ve never felt better. Sorry to see you called in over this juvenile vandalism, but I’m happy to show off the fruits of our labors. These are exciting times! All morning I’ve been sifting through the resumes of PhD candidates from all 50 states and nearly as many countries.”  
    <br>
    He motioned me over to where he stood on the metal platform in the center of the large chamber. There was a controller with large glowing green and red buttons sticking out of the platform which I understood at once to be the controls for yet another crude elevator. Though I was admittedly grateful to go to a slightly lower level. As we descended he told me about the project. 
    <br>
    Holmes – Sheriff, this odd salad bowl of a room you’re standing in is a giant electrostatic generator, and a point of pride if I might add. My engineers lovingly refer to it as the “Bolt Chamber.” 
<br>
“Electrostatic...oh like one of those steel balls at county fair that raise the hairs of giggling teenagers when they touch it?” 
<br>
Holmes - Precisely Sheriff! Your coy, country charm doesn’t fool me. People say you’re a well-read man. 
<br>
"I can hold my own at trivia night Doc, but nuclear physics flies a little over my head." 
<br>
Holmes – Oh it’s an acquired taste Sheriff. Well, you recall my little song and dance about ‘tempting the science of stars?’ In truth, my endeavors are a bit more down to Earth. There’s another form in which fusion appears in nature, though to a much smaller degree; lightning. 
<br>
"You have the class’s attention so far. You’re planning to heat all the homes in this county with lightning?"
<br>
Holmes - Not quite, we’ll use the static discharge to spark a much bigger fusion reaction. That’s what lightning is after all, one enormous static discharge built up in the clouds. But where nature builds up charge with condensed water vapor and ice crystals over a few square miles of gray sky, we’re going to pull that off in this room. Beneath the metal grate under your feet is a special sandy mixture of ultrafine salts and minerals. We clear this chamber a pump disperses it into the air. While this happens static walls to either side rotate, building up charge until bolts form. 
<br>
“Sounds like your salad bowl is more like a salad spinner." 
<br>
Holmes – Indeed Sheriff. We may have to re-think 'Bolt Camber.' Anyway, at that point deuterium laced heavy water is misted into the chamber and before long... 
<br>
“Sorry, heavy water?” 
<br>
Holmes – yes, it’s the other molecular form that water can form in nature. It has more neutrons, and those mighty particles are the final ingredient that makes it all work.
<br>
"Well, that's sounds like a spicy salad indeed, but let me ask you Doctor, who would want to interrupt your work here?" 
</p>

Sheriff – What do you know about the Bolt chamber Victor? Do you ever see anybody in there after hours? Does it close for the night when you guys leave?
